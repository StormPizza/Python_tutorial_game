# Python_tutorial_game

This is a short python game I created while I was completing the Learn Python the Hard Way set of tutorials when I was first starting to learn Python.

This was specifically this was for [exercise 45](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex45.html). I have long completed all of their tutorials, but this particular one was important because I spent a significant amount of time modifying and updating this short game and learned a great deal in the process.

To Use:
- Open Terminal
- go to directory
- $ python ex45.py

Notes:
- It is completely text-based, piloted within terminal
- I left an issue where the final room final battle is actually just the store
