# Python_tutorial_game

This is a short python simple-Deck-building game I created while I was completing the Learn Python the Hard Way set of tutorials when I was first starting to learn Python.

This was specifically this was for [exercise 45](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex45.html). I have long completed all of their tutorials, but this particular one was important because I spent a significant amount of time modifying and updating this short game and learned a great deal in the process.

To Use:
- Open Terminal
- go to directory
- $ python ex45.py

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Notes:
- It is completely text-based, piloted within terminal
- You have a starting deck of 10 cards, and you draw 5 cards, of which you will add the values on them to make your power.
- You will face 20 floors, and on each floor/level, you will choose between 3 rooms, each room has an individual monster you can choose to fight. When you fight the monster, you compare your power with the monster's and if yours is higher you instantly win the fight. If your power is lower, you still have a chance to win the fight, but you will take one damage.
- By selecting one of the three rooms, you also select the prize you will receive. That is, a card that will be added to your deck to make it more powerful or choosing to remove the weakest card from your discard pile.
- I left an issue where the final room final battle is actually just the store
